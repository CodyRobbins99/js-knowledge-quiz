# A JavaScript Knowledge Quiz Coded by Cody Robbins

## Purprose:

To underline the skills I have began to develop during this coding bootcamp, I have created a JavaScript knowledge 
quiz that utilizes serveral different JavaScript, HTML, and CSS methods I have learned so far.

## Code Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Quiz Logic:

The quiz starts when the "Test My Knowledge" button is pressed, adding 90 seconds to the clock and displaying the first question.
For each right answer, the user is awarded with 5 points. For each incorrect answer however, the user is deducted 5 points from 
their total score as well as 5 seconds from the clock. When the User has either answered all questions, or the timer expires, the
quiz is over and the user is brought to a screen with their score and an input field for their initials. The Initials of the top 5
scores will be displayed on the high score screen, which appears after every quiz taken, or by navigating to it with the "View high scores"
button on the home screen.
